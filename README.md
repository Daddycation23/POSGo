# Welcome to POSGo, the point of sale app on-the-go! üëã

This is a point of sale app on-the-go for small businesses, it is free and open source, built with React Native and Expo.

## Navigating the app
There are 3 buttons and 2 tabs when you open the app:
Buttons:
   - The "Add New Menu" button takes you to the add new menu item screen.
   - The "New Cart" button takes you to the new cart screen.
   - The "Saved Carts" button takes you to the saved carts screen, which is basically just new carts that you saved.

Tabs:
   - The home tab takes you to the home screen.
   - The orders history tab takes you to the orders history screen.

1. The home screen is the main screen you'll see when you open the app. It shows a list of all the products in the menu.
